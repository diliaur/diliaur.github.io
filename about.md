Hi, I'm Diliaur! I'm a Palauan data enthusiast, coder, artist, and photographer living in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi. I love to experiment in the digital and analog.

In May 2019 I graduated with my Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. My capstone project focused on gathering requirements for a genealogy-tracking software application for Palauan users, with a special emphasis on decolonial critiques of research & design and how software is being used to aid Indigenous resurgence.

In my spare time I like to work on my [photography](https://www.instagram.com/diliaur.jpg) and illustration, knit, or settle in with a good book. I very occasionally update [my blog](https://code680.wordpress.com) to document my coding exploits and hobbies and to work on my essay-writing skills.
