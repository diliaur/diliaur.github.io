Hi, I'm Diliaur! I'm a Palauan coder, designer, and photographer living in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi. I love to make things that are beautiful and useful.

In May 2019 I graduated with my MS in Computer Science from the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. For my capstone project, I focused on requirements gathering for a genealogy-tracking software application aimed at Palauan users, with a special emphasis on decolonial critiques of research & design and how software is being used to aid Indigenous resurgence.

In my spare time I like to work on my [photography](https://www.instagram.com/diliaur.jpg) and illustration, or settle in with a good book. I also run [a blog](https://code680.wordpress.com) to document my coding exploits and hobbies and to work on my essay-writing skills.
