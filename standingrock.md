<span class="quote">
The Standing Rock Sioux Reservation is situated in North and South Dakota. The people of Standing Rock, often called Sioux, are members of the Dakota and Lakota nations. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe stands by its right to self-government as a sovereign nation, which includes taking a government-to-government stance with the states and federal government entities. Having signed treaties as equals with the United States Government in 1851 and in 1868, which established the original boundaries of the Great Sioux Nation. The tribe staunchly asserts these treaty rights to remain steadfast and just as applicable today as on the day they were made.

What is the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL)?
</span>
<span class="quote">
The Dakota Access Pipeline Project is a new underground crude oil pipeline designed to transport 470,000 barrels of crude oil per day (with a growth potential up to 570,000 barrels per day) from the Bakken/Three Forks formations in North Dakota to a terminus near Patoka, Illinois. The project will require the construction of approximately 1,172 miles of 12-inch to 30-inch diameter pipeline through the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois terminating near Patoka, Illinois.

	* Provide a safer way to transport crude oil (source: http://www.daplpipelinefacts.com/resources/faq.html)
	* ?

<span class="question">
Why are people protesting the DAPL?
</span>

The construction of the DAPL passes into tradtionally sovereign Native American tribal lands, which already have been decreased in a long history of the US government disrespect and repeal of land treaties. The Standing Rock Tribe not only holds these lands sacred and sovereign, but also the waterways which give life to the people living on the land, which would be poisoned by the oil pipeline construction and operation.
