### A Simple WordPress Post Slider
![A Simple Slider for WordPress](/img/slider.gif)

[visit](https://www.cseashawaii.org) - [github](https://github.com/diliaur/simple-slider-2)

This is a custom featured post slider (WordPress plugin) built for UH CSEAS, alongside the theme. There are several third-party slider plugins, but none did exactly what we needed (in terms of how to feature posts) as well as matched our website design. Thus, "A Simple Slider" was born.

**Used**: JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS
