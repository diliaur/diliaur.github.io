Welcome to the homepage for the project Palau Gen, which aims to supplement Palauan genealogy knowledge practices with a Facebook-based web app.

Currently, the project is in the first round of interviews phase. If you are Palauan and interested in being interviewed, or taking an online survey, please email me at diliaur{AT}hawaii{dot}edu.

Eventually, the survey link and evolving results will be posted on this page.
