## East-West Center 16th International Graduate Student Conference (IGSC) Program Booklet Cover and Poster (2017)

This project was undertaken with the two IGSC organizing co-chairs and overseen by the East-West Center (EWC) Publications Manager. The design brief was fairly open, but required the use of approved branding colors, with a request to incorporate elements of the East-West Center campus. Additionally, the poster must give an overview of the conference and keynote speaker.

The featured image is of the Imin Conference Center, a building instantly recognizable to EWC participants and staff, with [lofty architectural roots](http://www.honolulumagazine.com/Honolulu-Magazine/May-2019/Internationally-Renowned-Architect-IM-Pei-Leaves-Rich-Honolulu-Design-Legacy/). By depicting only part of the building the imagery avoids being too literal. Imin Center takes on the hue the daytime sky, accenting the chosen color palette. The EWC logo stands out boldly in classic red.
